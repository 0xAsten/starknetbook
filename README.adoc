IMPORTANT: The Starknet Book is a work in progress, shaped by ongoing community input. Some sections may be incomplete or still under review and are marked under a üöß emoji. We welcome your suggestions, feedback, and content contributions to make this book a reliable guide for everyone.
====

The Starknet Book is a step-by-step guide aimed at teaching you the essentials of Starknet development. It's a community effort, with each chapter guiding you through the Starknet ecosystem.

Understanding Cairo, the key programming language for Starknet smart contracts, is crucial. That's why this book works hand-in-hand with the Cairo Book, another community resource. You can access the Cairo Book https://book.cairo-lang.org/[**here**].

In short, the Cairo Book helps you master Cairo, while The Starknet Book focuses on Starknet's specific features. For a well-rounded understanding, we recommend exploring both. This book will introduce you to tools, architecture, account setups, STARKs, and Starknet-specific apps.

== Where to Start?

Depending on your goals and interests, you can choose different paths through the Starknet Book. Here are some recommendations based on various objectives:

* If you're a *complete beginner* and want to start learning about Cairo and Starknet from scratch, follow the book in its entirety, starting with *Introduction to Starknet*.

* If you're an *experienced developer* looking to quickly dive into writing scalable and decentralized smart contracts, focus on the Cairo Book, particularly *chapter 12: Starknet Smart Contracts* (https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-00-starknet-smart-contracts.html[link]).

* If you're a *frontend developer* wanting to integrate Starknet with a React frontend using Javascript, prioritize the *starknet-js* and *starknet-react* subchapters in *Starknet Tooling*

* If you're a *DevOps engineer* or *node operator* interested in running a Starknet node and indexer, head straight to *Starknet Architecture*.

* If you're a *security researcher* or *smart contract auditor* wanting to learn about the Account Abstraction feature and its implications, go for *Account Abstraction*.

* If you're a *blockchain enthusiast* curious about the underlying architecture and mechanics of Starknet and Cairo, explore *Starknet Architecture*.

* If you're a *cryptography expert* or *researcher* eager to understand the fundamentals of STARKs and their connection to the Starknet ecosystem, delve into *STARKs*.

Feel free to mix and match these paths based on your unique interests and requirements.
