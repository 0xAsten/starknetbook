=== ZK Terminology

Zero Knowledge Proof Systems are proof systems in which there is secret information known to the `prover` that is not known to the `verifier`, and the verifier is still convinced of the computational claim.

A `non-interactive` proof system is an abstract machine that models computation between the two parties(prover and verifier).

A `succinct` proof system is one in which the verifier can run an order of magnitute faster than a naive re-execution of the program
