= The Lifecycle of Transactions

ðŸŽ¯ +++<strong>+++Camper: +++</strong>+++ feel free to add a PR to add content to this or other sections. Let's set up the Starknet Book together. ðŸŽ¯

On StarkNet Alpha the two types of transactions are `DEPLOY` or `INVOKE`.
They go through the following lifecycle as they are submitted from the clients to the sequencer:

NOT_RECEIVED \-> RECEIVED \-> PENDING \-> REJECTED || ACCEPTED_ON_L2 \-> ACCEPTED_ON_L1
