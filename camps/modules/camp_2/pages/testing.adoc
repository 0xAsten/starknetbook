= Testing StarkNet Contracts

ðŸŽ¯ +++<strong>+++Camper: +++</strong>+++ feel free to add a PR to add content to this or other sections. Let's set up the Starknet Book together. ðŸŽ¯

We left testing our contract for last; however, remember that testing is the first step in our sanity process for building smart contracts:

. Unit tests;
. Dev/local network;
. Test network:
. Main network.

Testing ensures that your code remains reliable even when we change it. The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: *unit tests* and *integration tests*.

* *Unit tests* are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces.
* *Integration tests* are entirely external to the library and use its code in the same way any other external code would. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html[The Rust Programming Language]).

Ideally, we would like to test all possible flows in our smart contract. Thus, our contract would have _100% code coverage_. However, we could lag behind this number; Code coverage of 80% is considered a good number.
