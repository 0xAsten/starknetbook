= Starknet Architecture

As you dive into building scalable web3 applications, understanding StarkNet's architecture and key components is crucial. This chapter aims to equip you with the insights needed to efficiently develop and deploy decentralized applications (dApps).

We'll explore the following topics:

- L2 Components: Overview of the different StarkNet components (Sequencer, Prover, Full Nodes) and their network roles.
- Tx Lifecycle: Discussion of the various states a Layer 2 transaction goes through, and the implications of considering a state as "final."
- Sequencer: The Sequencer's workflow in generating blocks.
- Prover: The Prover's workflow in generating proofs, focusing more on process than mathematical details.
- L1 Components: Analysis of the on-chain Verifier and Fact Registry, including how an L1 escape hatch functions.
- L3 and App Chains, and more.

By the chapter's end, you'll possess a comprehensive understanding of StarkNet's architecture, enabling you to make well-informed choices in dApp development and deployment.
