= Starknet Tooling

Today, Starknet provides all essential tools for building decentralized applications (dApps), compatible with multiple languages like JavaScript, Rust, and Python. You can use the Starknet SDK for development. Front-end developers can use Starknet.js with React, while Rust and Python work well for back-end tasks.

We welcome contributors to enhance existing tools or develop new solutions.

In this chapter, you'll explore:

* Wallets: Learn about Starknet-compatible wallets like Argent and Braavos
* Frameworks: Build using Protostar or Hardhat
* SDKs: Discover multi-language support through Starknet.js, Starknet-rs, Starknet_py, and Caigo
* Front-end Development: Use Starknet.js and React
* Testing: Understand testing methods with Protostar and the Devnet

By chapter's end, you'll have a complete grasp of Starknet's toolset, enabling efficient dApp development.
