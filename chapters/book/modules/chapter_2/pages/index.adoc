= Starknet Tooling

[NOTE]
====
To make the most of this chapter, a basic grasp of the Cairo programming language is advised. We suggest reading chapters 1-6 of the link:https://book.cairo-lang.org/title-page.html[Cairo Book], covering topics from 'Getting Started' to 'Enums and Pattern Matching.' Follow this by studying the link:https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-00-starknet-smart-contracts.html[Starknet Smart Contracts chapter] in the same book. With this background, you'll be well-equipped to understand the examples presented here.

Today, Starknet provides all essential tools for building decentralized applications (dApps), compatible with multiple languages like JavaScript, Rust, and Python. You can use the Starknet SDK for development. Front-end developers can use Starknet.js with React, while Rust and Python work well for back-end tasks.

We welcome contributors to enhance existing tools or develop new solutions.

In this chapter, you'll explore:

* Frameworks: Build using Protostar or Hardhat
* SDKs: Discover multi-language support through Starknet.js, Starknet-rs, Starknet_py, and Caigo
* Front-end Development: Use Starknet.js and React
* Testing: Understand testing methods with Protostar and the Devnet

By chapter's end, you'll have a complete grasp of Starknet's toolset, enabling efficient dApp development.

Here's a quick rundown of the tools that could be used for Starknet development and that we'll cover in this chapter:

. Scarb: A package manager that compiles your contracts.
. Starkli: A CLI tool for interacting with the Starknet network.
. Foundry: For contract testing.
. Katana: Creates a local test node.
. SDKs: starknet.js, Starknet.py, and starknet.rs interface with Starknet using common programming languages.
. Starknet-react: Builds front-end apps using React.
