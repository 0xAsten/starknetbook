== What is Starkware?

Starkware is a technology company in the blockchain industry that focuses on the development and deployment of zk-STARK technology. Starkware was founded in 2018, and since then, it has been at the forefront of the advancement of STARK-based technologies in the blockchain industry.

StarkWare's first key innovation was StarkEx, which, based on a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, has become one of the largest Layer 2 solution in production on Ethereum since its inception in June 2020. It has achieved this through leveraging STARK proofs, which ensure the validity of large batches of transactions processed off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint.

Starkware's second significant contribution to the blockchain industry is Cairo, a programming language optimized for writing efficient STARK proofs, enabling scalable computation for decentralized applications. Cairo, with its efficiency and Turing-completeness, became a vital tool for developers, both off-chain and on Starknet.

Starknet, which is Starkware's latest accomplishment, represents a significant leap in the field of Layer 2 solutions.

Starkware made the decision to establish Starknet as a permissionless, decentralized network, governed by the Starknet Foundation. The goal is to ensure that Starknet becomes a community-driven project where many entities contribute to its evolution and development.
