= Kakarot zkEVM

Built atop CairoVM, Kakarot zkEVM provides a bridge between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cairo, offering a recognizable abstraction layer for EVM developers.

== The Role of Virtual Machines

A https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine.html[Virtual Machine (VM)] is a software entity emulating a physical computer, running its distinct OS. For example, a virtual MacOS can operate within a physical PC. VMs have become indispensable in cloud contexts, providing resources for various users efficiently.

== Understanding zkEVM

zkEVM emulates the EVM, interpreting high-level languages or bytecodes just like the Ethereum client. It authenticates Ethereum code executions using validity proofs. By condensing transactions into a digest for Ethereum, zkEVM optimizes block space, reducing gas costs and boosting speed.

Given the EVM wasn’t initially designed for zero-knowledge proofs, optimizing zkEVM's efficiency is pivotal for Ethereum’s scalability.

== Degrees of EVM Compatibility

zkEVM's fidelity to Ethereum varies across three categories:

=== Language Equivalence 

Translates EVM bytecode to languages like Cairo optimized for zero-knowledge proof generation. While efficient, transitioning existing EVM tools and protocols poses challenges.

=== Bytecode Equivalence 

These VMs directly interpret EVM bytecode, achieving in-depth Ethereum compatibility. The challenge is EVM’s non-alignment with zero-knowledge proofs, causing inefficiencies.

=== Consensus Equivalence 

The peak of EVM compatibility. Here, zkEVMs don't require Ethereum to re-process cryptographic proofs. Though currently theoretical, Kakarot's team is actively exploring this level of compatibility.

== Dive into Kakarot

Written in Cairo, https://www.kakarot.org/[Kakarot zkEVM] interprets the EVM, enabling verification of Solidity bytecode on Ethereum. It streamlines the development and deployment of EVM applications, offering a platform akin to Ethereum or Polygon.

== Addressing Data Availability

Storing state data on Ethereum ensures user trust, but the high costs necessitate alternatives:

=== Validium:

Stores all state data off-chain to increase transaction throughput.

=== Volition:

Allows users to decide between Ethereum-based or off-chain storage via a centralized entity.

== Kakachin L3 zkEVM 

Combining Kakarot and Madara leads to Kakachin, echoing Starknet's scaling vision. To make Kakachin consensus-equivalent, modifications like translating Ethereum rules into Cairo and shifting to Keccak MPT are essential.

== Kakachin’s Role in Scalability

Functioning as an advanced Ethereum node on Starknet L2, Kakachin facilitates multiple L3 to L5 zkEVMs writing to Starknet, enhancing scalability while cutting costs.

== Harnessing Kakarot

=== Migrating Ethereum Contracts to Starknet

With Kakarot's tools, Ethereum-deployed contracts can run on Starknet without modifications. This facilitates faster migrations without needing Solidity-to-Cairo conversions.

=== Simplifying Starknet Deployments for Solidity Developers

Kakarot allows developers to deploy on Starknet using familiar Solidity, without diving into Cairo, marrying convenience with performance benefits.
