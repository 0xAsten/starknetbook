= The Beerus Light Client

Blockchain technologies promise decentralization, but measuring and ensuring this decentralization remains a challenge. A variety of metrics have been developed, including the Nakamoto coefficient. Nonetheless, the core of decentralization lies in the transparent and equitable access and modification of the blockchain.

== Understanding Decentralization in Blockchains

Decentralization stands as the cornerstone of blockchain technology. But, how does one gauge the depth of decentralization in a system? Numerous metrics like the https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/nakamoto-coefficient-decentralization/[Nakamoto coefficient] exist, yet the core principle remains the same: A blockchain's true test is its open accessibility and the capability of its users to fairly read, validate, and update its data.

== The Role of Full Nodes

A full node exemplifies the most autonomous and decentralized method of engaging with Ethereum. It offers users their personal blockchain copy for instant queries and direct access to Ethereum's P2P network. This autonomy derives from its ability to validate every incoming transaction and maintain an exhaustive copy of Ethereum's Patricia Merkle Trie. Yet, as Ethereum expands, the resource demands of a full node rise, leading users to potentially depend on centralized services, like https://www.alchemy.com/[Alchemy]. This dependency raises several security concerns.

== Storage Proofs Explained

Storage proofs act as cryptographic attestations of data's existence on the blockchain at a specified timestamp.

=== How it Works

Every new data entry gets hashed as a "leaf" into a structure known as a state tree. The subsequent hashing of this data with others forms parent nodes, culminating in a singular state root. This root embodies the entire dataset. A storage proof requires this specific data and its tree path, producing a composite of the data and its location.

=== Optimization Approaches

Pairing storage proofs with succinct proof systems, like STARKs, facilitates efficient data verification. Powerful, centralized computers can generate concise proofs about the data, sparing clients from local storage proof execution.

== Light Nodes: An Introduction

Addressing full nodes' limitations, Ethereum has embedded support for light nodes, offering a computationally efficient alternative.

=== Types of Light Clients

Light nodes employ two key client types:

- Light Consensus Client 
- Light Execution Client

Designed for resource-constrained environments, these clients uphold Ethereum's integrity while minimizing resource consumption.

=== Consensus Mechanisms

Rather than storing exhaustive blockchain copies, light clients like https://github.com/a16z/helios[Helios] fetch data from centralized RPC nodes and validate against a condensed Ethereum state. This consensus model relies on a subset of Ethereum validators, the "sync committee", chosen periodically.

=== Validating Headers

Having the freshest chain state, light nodes can verify RPC-provided data's accuracy by referencing their block headers, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.

=== Light Node Variations

Depending on the combination of light and full client software, nodes differ in their "lightness". The configurations range from completely light to mixtures of light and full client setups.

== Beerus: The Stateless Client

Starknet's provable programming approach allows it to introduce a stateless client, https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/beerus[Beerus], which transcends Ethereum's light clients. Beerus, requiring no local storage of Starknet or Ethereum state, revolutionizes client interaction with blockchains.

The workflow:

1. A user sends a Starknet state query via Beerus.
2. Beerus forwards the query to a centralized RPC node running Starknet software.
3. The RPC node responds with the data and its corresponding storage proof.
4. Concurrently, Beerus liaises with Helios to fetch Starknet's most recent proven state root, as recorded on Ethereum.
5. Validating the data from the RPC node against Ethereum's Patricia Merkle Trie confirms its authenticity.

This process is depicted in the accompanying diagram:
