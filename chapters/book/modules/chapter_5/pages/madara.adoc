= Madara Sequencer

The advancement of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous scaling solutions, a prominent one being the "rollup". This chapter delves into the intricacies of these solutions, with a specific focus on Madara.

== Summary of the Layer 2 (L2) 

Layer 2 solutions, often referred to as rollups, provide an off-chain environment. Here, users can:
 
- Execute smart contracts.
- Perform transactions intended for the Ethereum network.

Following these operations, rollups then communicate the changes back to the Ethereum network as state updates. 

One notable advantage of rollups is their economical and swift state updating capabilities compared to the primary Ethereum platform.

L2 solutions typically exhibit three core characteristics:

- State transition integrity.
- Data availability.
- Censorship resistance.

Utilizing the highly secure STARK protocol, Starknet upholds state transition integrity. Moreover, its integration with Ethereum L1 ensures optimal data availability. However, a present challenge is the centralized control over layer 2 sequencers, emphasizing the need for enhanced network censorship resistance.

== Evolution Beyond L2

In a recent https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html[article], Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin, sheds light on three transformative phases vital for Ethereum's growth. One such transition involves "fractal scaling".

https://hackmd.io/@kalmanlajko/rkgg9GLG5[Fractal scaling] aims to bolster Ethereum by allowing the deployment of highly specialized blockchains, or "layers", atop the Ethereum framework. This approach augments both flexibility and scalability within the network.

Central to this initiative, Starknet champions the creation of custom fractal blockchains, using Starknet's foundational layer. This strategy empowers Starknet to extend its robust technology in amplifying Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap.

_Defining Layers_

To address any ambiguities, a "layer 2" system can be characterized as:

- A structure designed to augment blockchain scalability and transactional throughput.
- A manifestation of the "blockchain within a blockchain" concept, possessing independent transaction processing mechanisms and maintaining an internal state.
- A system that inherits Ethereum's comprehensive safety assurances.

== Diving into Substrate

https://substrate.io/[Substrate] serves as a versatile SDK, facilitating the creation of peer-to-peer networks complete with efficient consensus systems. This enables a streamlined deployment of bespoke blockchains.

In terms of structure, Substrate encompasses multiple modules, referred to as "pallets". Available pallets cater to a range of functionalities, from staking and tokens (fungible & non-fungible) to governance. Additionally, Substrate incorporates a dedicated smart contract pallet named "pallet-contracts", allowing chains built on Substrate to seamlessly integrate smart contract features.

In its default state, a Substrate node employs the https://docs.substrate.io/learn/consensus/[Aura] consensus protocol and relies on https://medium.com/polkadot-network/grandpa-block-finality-in-polkadot-an-introduction-part-1-d08a24a021b5[Grandpa] for transaction finality. Furthermore, it's equipped to execute both WASM and EVM bytecode via a pre-configured client.

== Introducing Madara

https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara[Madara], at its core, is a blockchain framework based on Substrate. Mirroring Substrate's ability to deploy custom chains that inherently support Solidity code, Madara introduces chains compatible with the https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm[Cairo VM] and https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier[blockifier]. This capability allows the execution of Cairo programs and Starknet smart contracts, primarily through the incorporation of a "starknet" pallet within Substrate.

Capitalizing on Cairo's capabilities, Madara ensures the provability of program execution via the STARK protocol. For a comprehensive insight into Madara's architectural design, please refer to https://docs.madara.zone/architecture[this]. Additionally, those interested in deploying a personalized Madara chain can access a step-by-step https://docs.madara.zone/build[tutorial] to facilitate the process.
