= Pioneering Applications: Expanding Starknet's Horizons

Developers working in the Starknet ecosystem seek to push the boundaries, developing innovative applications and use-cases. This chapter illuminates two pioneering areas of exploration in the Starknet ecosystem (more soon): On-Chain Artificial Intelligence and Storage Proofs.

* *On-Chain Artificial Intelligence*: Starknet's increased transactions per second (TPS) and affordable computation costs have made it feasible to host AI models on-chain, marking a paradigm shift towards decentralized and transparent AI applications.

* *Storage Proofs*: As a cryptographic tool, storage proofs facilitate trustless cross-chain information access. They provide a robust method for verifying data's integrity across different chains, reinforcing security and efficiency in the decentralized ecosystem.

Each of these applications harnesses Starknet's capabilities, coupled with cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, to offer revolutionary solutions that contribute to a more transparent, efficient, and secure decentralized environment. 

This chapter delves deep into these topics, beginning with an examination of on-chain AI and the technological advancements in Starknet that have made this possibility a reality. We then explore the realm of storage proofs, understanding their role and the significant impact they have on cross-chain information access.
