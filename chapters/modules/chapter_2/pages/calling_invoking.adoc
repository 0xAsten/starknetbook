= Calling and Invoking Contracts

Let's interact with our deployed voting contract.

* Calling contracts refer to interacting with contract functions with the `@view` entry point (decorator). Since we are not altering the state of the network, and hence we do not need to pay fees, we do not need to sign the operation.
* Invoking contracts is interacting with contract functions with the `@external` entry point. We need to sign the transaction and pay the operation fee.
