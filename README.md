### Overview

Basecamp is a curriculum built to teach the fundamental building blocks of the Cairo programming language and StarkNet development. It is divided by Camps. Finish the curriculum and you will be conquer the Ethereum world.


### Route

0. [Primer](./primer/README.md)
1. [Camp 1: Getting Started](./camp_1/README.md)
2. [Camp 2: BUIDL and Tooling](./camp_2/README.md)
3. [Camp 3: StarkNet](./camp_3/README.md)
4. [Camp 4: Peering into the future](./camp_4/README.md)
5. [Camp 5: Cairo](./camp_5/README.md)
6. [Camp 6: STARKs](./camp_6/README.md)

### Where to start?

Everybody has different goals in their Cairo and StarkNet journey. Follow this guide to continue trough the Basecamp; do you...

* ...want to start coding scalable and descentralized smart contracts right away? **Camps 1 and 2**.
* ...have a hackathon next week? **Camps 1 and 2**.
* ...want to go deeper into StarkNet's power? **Go on to Camps 3 - 4**.
* ...want to explore how STARKs and Cairo are created? **Go on to camps 5 - 6**.
